# Color Correction and Compositing
This project applies different color corrections and compositing to the specificed image files. The inverted image inverts all of the RGB values to output a negative version of the original image. The grayscale image sets all RGB values to be equal creating a grayscale version of the original image. The color correct image applies a gain, offset, and gamma to the original image. The mixed image appplies a 75%/25% mix between the two original images.
